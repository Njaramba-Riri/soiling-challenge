            <p>
                WeLove was born out of a shared passion for making a meaningful difference in the lives of 
                persons with disabilities (PWDs). Our journey began at KISE during a hackathon, where a domain experts, various stakeholders and a group of students 
                came together with a common goal: to harness technology and innovation to address the challenges faced by PWDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by our compassion and empathy for individuals with disabilities, we embarked on a journey of exploration and discovery. 
                Through collaborative brainstorming sessions and tireless effort, we honed in on the pressing issue of toilet 
                training for disabled children particularly children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recognizing the significant 
                impact that effective toilet training can have on a child's independence and quality of life, we were determined to 
                find a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a commitment to making a positive impact, we embarked on a collaborative effort to harness the power of 
                artificial intelligence and machine learning in creating our unique toilet training assistance app. 
                Through insightful conversations and in-depth research, we gained a deep understanding of the complex needs and 
                struggles faced by children with ASD and their caregivers during the toilet training process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawing from our collective expertise and experiences, we designed WeLove to be more than just a toolâ€”it's a beacon 
                of hope and empowerment for families navigating the challenges of toilet training. By providing personalized 
                recommendations, progress tracking, and educational resources, we strive to offer comprehensive support tailored 
                to each child's unique journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team is driven by a shared mission: to transform the lives of disabled children and their families by equipping 
                them with the tools and resources they need to succeed. With dedication, innovation, and compassion at the core of 
                everything we do, we are committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.
            </p>
            <p>
                As young professionals, we are dedicated to making a positive impact in our communities and beyond. WeLove represents 
                our commitment to innovation, inclusivity, and compassion, and we are proud to be part of this transformative journey.
